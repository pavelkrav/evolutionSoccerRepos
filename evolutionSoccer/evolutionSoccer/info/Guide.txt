Hi there!
This application simulates a series of football matches between two teams.

After any team looses, its' parameters randomly changing using an evolution algorithm.
Changes are based on loose streak of the team and its' win/loose ratio. 
Loose streak affects on descendants amount and strategy changes. W/L ratio - on parameters' shift value.

Match is simulated according to teams' parameters.
Maintainly:	center affects on attacks amount;
		attack affects on chance to shoot on target;
		defence lowers this chance for enemy;
		goalkeepers' strength is affects on chance to save.

First of all you need to simulate a season (input 1 in menu).
By default you are offered to simulate 800 matches. But you can change this number.
While it is simulating, you can see starting and final teams parameters and tactics.
After you simulated a season you can open a graphs building form (input 3) or simulate a new one.

While using graphs form:
There is a menu strip.
"Graphs" branch obviously allows you to build graphs or clear the coordinate field.
"Colour" branch allows you to change colours of teams' graphs separately.
Also, you can change size of window with no harm.

It is not fully balanced yet, but results of matches are close to real ones, so I hope you will enjoy this stuff.



Used and learned stuff:

catching exceptions,
delegates and lambda expressions,
events,
inheritance and overrides,
windows forms over console application,
windows forms themselves,
Process.Start(path),
random in loop,
relative addressing,
...
to be continued
